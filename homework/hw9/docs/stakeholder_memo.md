Stakeholder Memo: Housing Price Prediction Project
To: Real Estate Investment TeamFrom: Data Science TeamDate: August 20, 2025Subject: Housing Price Prediction Project Overview  
Dear Team,  
Our project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict housing prices in your target region, empowering you to identify undervalued properties and optimize investment returns. By analyzing historical data on house attributes like size, location, and amenities, we aim to provide accurate predictions, evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), to support data-driven decisions. The model will offer interpretable visualizations and risk assessments to ensure confidence in investment strategies.  
We are currently scoping the project, assuming access to reliable housing data and the predictive power of key features. Potential risks include data gaps or market volatility, which we will address through robust preprocessing and validation. Deliverables will include cleaned datasets (data/processed/), analysis notebooks (notebooks/), and reports (docs/). Please share your priorities, such as specific regions or features, to guide our next steps in data collection and modeling.  
Best regards,Data Science Team
