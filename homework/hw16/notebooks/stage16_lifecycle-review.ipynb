    "- **Most Reusable Part**: The `notebooks/utils.py` module is highly reusable, with functions like `train_model` and `fill_missing_values` that can be applied to other regression projects with slight modifications.\n",
    "- **Best Support for Teammate**: A detailed `README.md` with setup guide, `requirements.txt` for dependencies, and a `summary.md` with key results would be most helpful. A `faq.md` in `docs/` could address common issues."
