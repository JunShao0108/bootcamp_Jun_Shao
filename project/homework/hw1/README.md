# Housing Price Prediction Project

## Project Scoping Paragraph
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for housing prices in a given region, enabling real estate investors to make informed investment decisions. By analyzing historical housing data (e.g., size, location, and amenities), the model will predict future house prices to identify undervalued properties. The primary stakeholders are real estate investment analysts and decision-makers who need accurate predictions to prioritize investment opportunities. The project will deliver a predictive outcome in the form of a machine learning model, evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and artifacts including a trained model and visualizations of price trends, providing actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Goals → Lifecycle → Deliverables Mapping
- **Goal**: Predict housing prices to guide investment decisions.
  - **Lifecycle Stage**: 
    - **Data Collection**: Gather housing datasets (e.g., from Kaggle or public APIs).
    - **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess data in `/data/`.
    - **Model Development**: Build and train models in `/src/` and `/notebooks/`.
    - **Evaluation**: Assess model performance (RMSE, R²) in `/notebooks/`.
    - **Reporting**: Document findings and visualizations in `/docs/`.
  - **Deliverables**: 
    - Cleaned dataset (`/data/housing_data.csv`).
    - Python scripts for model training (`/src/model.py`).
    - Jupyter Notebook with analysis (`/notebooks/housing_analysis.ipynb`).
    - Stakeholder memo and visualizations (`/docs/stakeholder_memo.md`).
