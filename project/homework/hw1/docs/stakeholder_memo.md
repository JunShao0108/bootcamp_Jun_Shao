This project aims to predict housing prices in a target region to support your investment decision-making process. By leveraging historical data on house attributes (e.g., size, location, amenities), we will develop a machine learning model to forecast prices and identify undervalued properties. The primary goal is to provide you with accurate, data-driven predictions to prioritize high-return investment opportunities. The deliverables include a predictive model, performance metrics (e.g., RMSE), and visualizations of price trends, all accessible via a structured GitHub repository (/data/, /src/, /notebooks/, /docs/). Your feedback on key features (e.g., location or property type) will guide model refinement to ensure actionable insights.
